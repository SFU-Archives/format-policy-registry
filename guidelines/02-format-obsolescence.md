# Format Obsolescence
Digital records are much more complex than paper records. In order to render a document on a computer screen, we need a particular program (software) that runs on a specific operating system (OS) that is installed on a physical computer of a certain type (hardware). This **hardware/software/OS configuration** is in constant evolution, and each component changes at different rates. As hardware/software/OS environments change over time, documents created in one environment may no longer be renderable in a later one.

A format becomes obsolete when you can no longer run the software required to read the file. The company that owns the format may go out of business and the software is no longer available. Or the develop remains active, but no longer makes available non-current versions of the software. If you can get the software, it may no longer run on currently available operating systems. If you can get a copy of the required OS, it may no longer be possible to install it on contemporary hardware. You may retain old computers to run old OS/sofware programs, but the hardware eventually breaks down and replacement parts are no longer available.

The problem is compounded if the format is proprietary and / or there is no openly published specification. If the spec is accessible, a developer should always be able to construct (at much cost) a viewer that will render the file. But if no spec is available, the only remaining option is "reverse engineering" which may or may not be possible in any given case, and where successful will likely be a violation of the format's license or patent.

All this points to the importance of open formats and openly published specification for long-term access.
