# Format Obsolescence
Digital records are much more complex than paper records. In order to render a document on a computer screen, we need a particular program (software) that runs on a specific operating system (OS) that is installed on a physical computer of a certain type (hardware). This **hardware/OS/software configuration** is in constant change, the components evolving at different rates. As hardware/OS/software environments change over time, documents created in one environment may no longer be renderable in a later one.

A format becomes obsolete when you can no longer run the software required to read the file. As formats evolve, newer versions will typically be "backwards compatible" only up to a certain point; after that, earlier versions may no longer be supported by the current version and the developer may no longer make available previous versions. Some developers may cease operations and their software becomes unavailable.

If you can still obtain non-current software, it may no longer run on currently available operating systems. If you can get a copy of the required OS, it may no longer be possible to install it on contemporary hardware. You can retain old computers to run old OS/sofware programs, but the hardware eventually breaks down and replacement parts will cease to be available.

The problem is compounded if the format is proprietary and / or there is no openly published specification. If the spec is accessible, a developer should in theory be able to construct (at much cost) a viewer that will render the file. But if no spec is available, the only remaining option is "reverse engineering" which may or may not be possible in any given case; and where it is successful, it will likely be a violation of the format's license or patent.

All this points to the importance of open formats and openly published specifications for long-term access.
