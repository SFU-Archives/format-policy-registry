# Format Policy Registry (FPR)
SFU Archives' Format Policy Registry (FPR) is a tool for managing digital file formats to ensure that digital materials transferred to the Archives for long-term preservation will continue to be accessible in the future.

The Archives will always retain files in their original formats. It may also, however, create copies in designated **preservation** and **access** formats ("normalization"). The FPR shows the Archives' preferred and acceptable file formats for transfer. For each, it specifies the designated preservation and access formats if they exist. It also provides notes explaining the Archives' policy choices, and it identifies gaps in current practice and the Archives' longer-term strategies to address these.

The FPR is organized into categories based on type, purpose, or use of files. The list of formats is not exhaustive, rather the FPR identifies only the most common formats that the records creators we serve tend to produce. If you have formats that do not appear in the FPR, you can still send them for transfer, but you should consult with an archivist first. Typically, the Archives can only provide **bit-level preservation** for formats not explicitly listed here. This means that we will preserve the integrity of the file (i.e. the string of 0s and 1s that make up the file's bitstream), but we cannot presently guarantee its future accessibility (i.e. the ability of software to successfully render file contents).

See the [Explanations section](explanations/00-introduction.md) for more information about the challenges posed by format obsolescence and strategies for ensuring long-term accessibility.
