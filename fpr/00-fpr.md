# Preferred and Accepable File Formats
The Format Policy Registry (FPR) records the decisions that SFU Archives has made regarding the file formats it will use for long-term preservation and access. These decisions are programmed into the Archives' digital preservation software ([Archivematica](https://www.archivematica.org/en/) so that it can automatically normalize the many different file formats we receive to a smaller set of designated formats.

For SFU departments and private donors who transfer digital records to SFU Archives, the FPR shows whic file format(s) are preferred, which are acceptable, and what level of support they can expect for each.

The FPR is an evolving document and will change in response to new knowledge about preservation formats and changes to the overall technology landscape.

## What does the FPR mean for you?
As a producer of digital records, you should be aware of the file formats you are using and make informed decisions about which ones are the most appropriate. If the file formats you are using do not appear on the FPR or have [bit-level support only](../guidelines/04-key-to-fpr-terms.md#bit-level), you may still transfer them to the Archives, but your records are at-risk of becoming inaccessible in the future. For records that have short-term value only, this may be acceptable. But for records that have long retention requirements or are scheduled for transfer to Archives for permanent preservation, the use of at-risk file formats is problematic. If this applies to your situation, you should consult the Archives to discuss options and make plans to mitigate risks.

## Format categories
Formats are group into categories based on file type, purpose, or use.
1. [Text documents](01-text-documents.md)
2. [Presentations](02-presentations.md)
3. [Spreadsheets and datasets](03-spreadsheets-and-datasets.md)
4. [Images](04-images.md)
5. [Email](05-email.md)
6. [Databases](06-databases.md)
7. [Audio](07-audio.md)
8. [Video](08-video.md)
9. [Websites](09-websites.md)
10. [Computer Assisted Design (CAD)](10-cad.md)
11. [Models](11-models.md)

## Future questions
There are categories of records that we have not yet determined how to manage over the long-term because they are so complex and so different from traditional analogue documents. For example, websites often have video, photographs, links to external sites, and even databases embedded in them. How do we preserve these so that they are recognizable many years later and can be reliably rendered on a computer screen? We need to continue to research and consult with the digital preservation community to resolve these and other issues.
